The first lab assignment is on understanding basic methods and functions on different python data types like string, integers, lists, dictionaries etc.
The assignment contains four parts. The first part is about using the print function to display different datatypes. The second and third part of the assignment is about using the pandas library to perform basic operations on dataframes and their management. The data to be used in this assignment was provided in the form of three .csv files. Part four deals with using matplot library to analyse data and show statistics visually and two .png files were created in the process.
